# RegisOwls_2020-2021_robot_code
Code repository for the Regis Owls robotics team for the 2020-2021 season.
# Purpose
In this repository, the members of the Regis Robotics Team will write programs for the robot that we'll be using in the 2020-2021 FTC competition. We'll use this space to collaborate on code, test things out, and learn how to code OpModes (short for Operational Modes), which are programs that are used to control FTC robots. We will have 2 main files, one for driving the robot manually, and one for autonomous mode. I advise anyone who wants to contribute to take a quick tutorial on how to use GitHub so that you can become familiar with how to write code, make suggestions, and push commits. The robot is coded in Java, so you should probably learn the basics of how java works if you don't already know and look at this link, which provides basic intructions on how to write OpModes: https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/wiki/Creating-and-Running-an-Op-Mode-(OnBot-Java) Good Luck!
